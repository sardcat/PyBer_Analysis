# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis
Ride Sharing Data Analysis w/ Python, Jupyter &amp; Matplotlib

## Overview

PyBer, a ride sharing service, has asked "the Team" to help analyize their data from 2019 to spot trends and variances. Data provided was broken down by cities that
PyBer services, drivers employed, fares and rides performed. A first delivered iteration focused on a series of broad graphic analysis; however a second summary 
request has been made.

## Results

Summarizing PyBer's data for 2019 by City Type, Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver (Fig. 1) highlights
some interesting trends. The number of Drivers and Rides performed in an Urban setting are orders of magnitude over Rural routes, yet yield the lowest Average Fare
per Ride and per Driver, while Suburban routes sit comfortably in the middle. Despite the low Average Fares for Rides and Drivers in Urban routes, the sheer number of
Urban Rides performed constitute nearly half of the Total Fares.

Figure 2 showcases a four (4) month break down of Fare data by City Types. Urban and Suburban Total Fares experienced an increase coming out of Janurary, while 
Rural routes opened with a small decline. All routes showed an uptick in Fares coming in to March, most likely due to spring weather; however Urban routes Fares then
underwent mild volatility. Suburban routes began a noticable increase in Fares leading out of April.
